File permissions
****************
changes the permissions for files and directories
3 types of users
  # primary
  # group
  # others
3 permissions for all users we have:
   # read (r)
   # write (w)
   # execute (x)
2 ways we can give permissions:
   1. symbolic or text method
   2. using mode number
notations
u:user
g:group
o:other
+:add permission
-: remove permission
r:read
w:write
x:execute

command used to change permissions for files and directories is
chmod : change mode
chmod u-w+x,g+x-w,o-wx <file name> {symbolic or text method)
      this command will change the permissions of user,group and others
       note + and- are used to add permission and remove permissions repectively.
chmod 777 new3.doc {using mode number} 777 is given to all user,group and others full permissions
