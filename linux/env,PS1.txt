
Environment variables
---------------------
envt variables are used to store info about the env in which program runs such as paths of files and directories,user preference and system setting.
printenv--->command to check env variables.

The 'export' command in Linux is used to set an environment variable. 
   export MY_VARIABLE="some_value"

for examples:
echo --> to print the contents of variables
echo "$SHELL"
echo "$BASH"
echo "$USER

PS1
-----
In Linux, PS1 is a shell variable used to define the format of the primary command prompt. It allows users to customize the appearance of the prompt according to their preferences. Here's a breakdown of PS1 along with some examples:

Basic PS1 Structure: The PS1 variable contains special escape sequences, which are replaced by various information when the prompt is displayed. The most common ones are:

\u: Username of the current user.
\h: Hostname up to the first ".".
\W: Current working directory (basename).
\w: Current working directory (full path).
\d: Date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26").
\t: Current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format.
\n: Newline.
\$: Indicates the type of user: $ for regular user and # for root.
Examples:

Example 1: Basic Prompt with Username and Directory:
PS1="\u@\h:\w\$ "
Output: user@hostname:/current/directory$

Example 2: Prompt with Current Time and Directory:
PS1="\t \w\$ "
Output: 14:25:06 /current/directory$

Example 3: Customized Prompt with Colors:
PS1="\[\033[1;32m\]\u@\h:\[\033[0;34m\]\w\[\033[0m\]\$ "
This example uses ANSI escape codes to add color. \[\033[1;32m\] sets the text color to green, \[\033[0;34m\] sets the text color to blue, and \[\033[0m\] resets the color to default.

Output: user@hostname:/current/directory$ (with colors)

Example 4: Multiline Prompt:
PS1="\u@\h:\w\n\$ "
Output:user@hostname:/current/directory$ 
Persistent Configuration: To make the PS1 changes permanent, you can add the PS1 assignment to your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc for Bash shell). After modifying the file, you need to either reload the shell or reopen a terminal for the changes to take effect.

Customizing PS1 allows users to create prompts that provide useful information or fit their aesthetic preferences, enhancing the command-line experience.

Prompt String (PS1)-->Prompt env variable
-------------------------------------------
PS1 is called primary prompt string and it is the default interaction prompt.
Bash allows these prompt strings (PS) to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:

\a : an ASCII bell character (07)
\d : the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
\D{format} : the format is passed to strftime(3) and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty format results in a locale-specific time representation. The braces are required
\e : an ASCII escape character (033)
\h : the hostname up to the first '.'
\H : the hostname
\j : the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
\l : the basename of the shellâ€™s terminal device name
\n : newline
\r : carriage return
\s : the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion following the final slash)
\t : the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
\T : the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
\@ : the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
\A : the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
\u : the username of the current user
\v : the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)
\V : the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
\w : the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
\W : the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
\! : the history number of this command
\# : the command number of this command
\$ : if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $
\nnn : the character corresponding to the octal number nnn
\\ : a backslash
\[ : begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
\] : end a sequence of non-printing characters

Color Codes
Here are the color codes you can use:

Black: \e[0;30m
Red: \e[0;31m
Green: \e[0;32m
Yellow: \e[0;33m
Blue: \e[0;34m
Magenta: \e[0;35m
Cyan: \e[0;36m
White: \e[0;37m
And for bright colors:

Bright Black: \e[1;30m
Bright Red: \e[1;31m
Bright Green: \e[1;32m
Bright Yellow: \e[1;33m
Bright Blue: \e[1;34m
Bright Magenta: \e[1;35m
Bright Cyan: \e[1;36m
Bright White: \e[1;37m
