Why linux?
 *linux is best suited for multiuser and multitask application.
 *linux is more attractive because it comes free of cost,open source software
 Note-unix and linux are case sensitive
 *linux has very important concept called 'terminal",is the gateway to the linux os.

Properties of Linux
Linux Pros
----------
• Linux is free
• Linux is portable to any hardware platform:
• Linux was made to keep on running:
• Linux is secure and versatile:
• Linux is scalable:
• The Linux OS and most Linux applications have very short debug-       
  times

Linux Cons
----------
• There are far too many different distributions
• Linux is not very user friendly and confusing for beginners

example of linux OS
Debian,Ubuntu,Fedora,Arch linux


Installing Linux in windows os
 *Two ways
    1.VM Ware
         *linux os inside windows os
    2.Cygwin
        * How install cygwin
          While installing cygwin choose the following packages
            .PERL 
            .Python
            .TCL
            .gvim
Understanding Cygwin
 *windows start type cygwin
understanding cygwin directory struture
  *System harddisk  is named as cygdrive
  *All the drives of my windows os will be present under/cygdrive
  *All directories(folders) are accessed using '/'(delimiter)separation
  *In Linux 'Tab'key play an important roll
  *tab button on keyboard is used to automatically fill the paths and names 

echo 'alias ll="ls -l"' >> ~/.bash_profile
bash:bourne again shell
pwd:present working directory
cd: change directory
cd /:root directory
cd ~:Home directory
cd .. goes to previous directory
cd ../../../ goes to previous directories(3 steps previous)
cd path1/path2/path3/: Absolute Path
cd 'dir name' :if directory name is 'my name'
cd "dir name" :if directory name is "my name"
cd dir\ name   :if directory name is my\ name
clear:it clear the terminal screen
ls:list the directory and files
man <command>:manual of given command
q: to exit from manual
ls /:list of root directory contents
ls ~:list of home directory contents
ls dir_name: list of "dir_name" contents
ls .. list the contents of previous directory
ls -l:long listing format
ls -a: list the hidden file and directories (list all files and directories)
ls -la: long list with hidden directories
ls -sl list the contents according to size
ls -t : sort by time, newest first;
ls -r : reverse order while sorting
ls -ltr:long list with time and reverse sorting
ls -d */:list of only directories

File management
---------------
command used to create files are
 *touch
 *cat
touch <filename1.ext> <filename2.ext> 
touch filename{1..10}.txt
How to open multiple files in vim editor
vi <firstfilename> In vim give :tabnew <secondfilename>
touch directory/filename --> this command create a file in a directory directly
this command creates the file 
 cat: its echoes what you typed
*cat: concatenate files and print on the standard output
 cat file_name:display the contents of the file
 cat dir1/filename 
 cat -b filename : add the line numbers to non-blank lines
 cat -n filename : add the line numbers to all lines
 cat > filename  : '>' this redirects and open the file for edit
 cat >> filename : '>>' this appends and edit without overwriting the previous data of file
cat file1 > file2 this command redirect the contents file1 to file2
cat dir1/filename display the content of the filename.

To create different type extention files with different names
------------------------------------------------------------- 
     for i in $(seq 1 5)
     do
     touch file$i.txt File$i.v newfile$i.py Sample$i.c Program$i
     done

Make Directories
----------------
mkdir <directory_name>: make directory
mkdir <name1> <name2> <name3>
mkdir <name1>/<name2>
mkdir dir{1..10}
mkdir -p <name1>/{name2,name3,name4}
mkdir -p <name1>/<name2>/<name3>/<name4>
mkdir -pv <name1>/<name2>/<name3>/<name4>
mkdir -p  its creates the directories with parent directory with sub directory
mkdir -pv print a message for each created directory
ls -R list out the directory structure 
 
rm & rmdir commands
-------------------
rmdir <dir_name>
rmdir -p <name1>/<name2>/<name3>/<name4>
rmdir -pv <name1>/<name2>/<name3>/<name4>
rm -rv <name1> rv--> means recrussive verbose

copying directories
******************** 
cp :{souce file/dir to destination file/dir}
cp sum1 sum2; [sum1 is copied to sum2]
cp filename{1..10}.txt directory
cp -r dir1 new_dir {it creates a new_dir and copies the content of dir1} 
cp -r dir1 dir3 { if dir3 already exists,it will copy the dir1 to dir3}{
cp -i without overwrite
cp ../test1.txt ../test2.txt . from previous directory it takes the files and copy to current directory [dot represent current directory]


Move Directories/files

mv source dir1 destination dir2 [dir1 moved to dir2]
mv dir1 ./dir11/dir12/dir13/dir14 {note '.' represent current directory}in this above command dir1 moved to sub directory dir14
mv -i file3.txt dir1
how to rename directories
mv junk junk1 {here the junk directory renamed as junk1} so 'mv' can be used for rename also
 mv example /cygdrive/c/Users/VLSIGURU/Desktop/ this command will move directory 'example' to desktop by the path given my us.
mv filename{1..10}.txt directory

Note: 1.mv command we can move  single source_file to single destination_file
      2.we can move multiple files to single directory (but the directory should exist)
      3.we can move single directory to single directory(its not compulsory that  
        destination directory should exist)
      4.we can move multiple directories to single directories(but destination directory 
        should exist)
