In Linux, pushd and popd are built-in shell commands used to manage the directory stack. They are particularly useful for navigating between directories quickly without losing track of the directories you have visited. Here's how they work:

pushd
The pushd command saves the current directory to the stack and then changes to the specified directory. If no directory is specified, it swaps the top two directories on the stack.

Usage:

pushd [directory]

Example:
$ cd /home/user/project
$ pushd /var/log
/var/log /home/user/project
In this example:
The current directory is /home/user/project.
pushd /var/log changes the directory to /var/log and adds /home/user/project to the stack.
The output shows the current stack with /var/log at the top and /home/user/project next.

popd
The popd command removes the top directory from the stack and changes the current directory to the new top directory.

Usage:
popd
Example:
$ popd
/home/user/project
In this example:
The current directory is /var/log.
popd removes /var/log from the stack and changes the directory to /home/user/project.
The output shows the new top directory, which is /home/user/project.

Practical Example
------------------
Start in the home directory:

$ cd ~
Use pushd to navigate to /etc and save the home directory to the stack:

$ pushd /etc
/etc /home/user

Now, navigate to /usr/bin using pushd:
$ pushd /usr/bin
/usr/bin /etc /home/user


Check the current stack:
$ dirs
/usr/bin /etc /home/user

Use popd to return to /etc:
$ popd
/etc /home/user

Use popd again to return to the home directory:
$ popd
/home/user
